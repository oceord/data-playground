# Weaviate Query statements

> [!NOTE]
> These query statements were partially generated by [phind](https://www.phind.com/) to explore different aspects of Weaviate.

## Embedding Your Dataset

- [x] Option 1 - Have Weaviate create vectors for you
  - Define a schema for the dataset and ensure the descriptions are embedded.
  - NOTE: this was the chosen option to facilitate data manipulation
    - The Weaviate instance from docker-compose has been set with only the `text2vec-transformers` module enabled, which allows "Weaviate to obtain vectors locally from text using a transformers-based model" ([link](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-transformers))
    - Additionally, the chosen embedding model for `text2vec-transformers` to work with was `snowflake-arctic-embedding-xs` due to it's reported high performance ([link](https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-xs))

- [x] ~~Option 2 - Specify custom vectors~~ (NOTE: preferred Option 1 over this one)
  - Use vectors created by the client and not by Weaviate.
