# TimescaleDB Query statements

> [!NOTE]
> These query statements were generated by [deepseek](https://chat.deepseek.com/) to explore different aspects of TimescaleDB.

## Setup

- [ ] Create a hypertable from the existing `events` table to enable time-series optimizations.
- [ ] Add a retention policy to automatically drop data older than 1 year from the `events` hypertable.
- [ ] Configure compression on the `events` hypertable to reduce storage usage.
- [ ] Set up a continuous aggregate to precompute daily event counts.
- [ ] Create a new hypertable with custom chunk intervals for better performance.

## Performance

- [ ] Enable compression on the `events` hypertable for data older than 30 days.
- [ ] View the chunk information for the `events` hypertable to understand data partitioning.
- [ ] Adjust the chunk interval for the `events` hypertable to optimize query performance.
- [ ] Analyze the query plan for a time-range query on the `events` hypertable.
- [ ] Drop chunks older than 6 months from the `events` hypertable to free up space.

## Time-series Handling

- [ ] Insert a new event into the `events` hypertable.
- [ ] Retrieve all events for a specific user within the last 7 days.
- [ ] Calculate the total number of events per day for the last month.
- [ ] Find the average price of products sold per brand in the last 30 days.
- [ ] Identify the top 5 most active users by event count in the last week.

## CRUD Operations

- [ ] Update the `event_type` for all events with a specific `user_id`.
- [ ] Delete all events older than 2 years from the `events` hypertable.
- [ ] Retrieve all events of a specific `event_type` within a time range.
- [ ] Insert multiple events into the `events` hypertable in a single query.
- [ ] Update the `price` field for events with a specific `product_id`.

## Indexing

- [ ] Create a B-tree index on the `user_id` column to speed up user-specific queries.
- [ ] Create a composite index on `event_time` and `event_type` for faster time-based filtering.
- [ ] Drop an existing index on the `brand` column if it is no longer needed.
- [ ] Create a hash index on the `user_session` column for faster equality searches.
- [ ] Analyze the performance impact of an index on a time-range query.

## Partitioning

- [ ] View the current chunking strategy for the `events` hypertable.
- [ ] Merge two chunks in the `events` hypertable to optimize storage.
- [ ] Split a chunk in the `events` hypertable to improve query performance.
- [ ] Add a new partition to the `events` hypertable for future data.
- [ ] Disable partitioning on the `events` hypertable temporarily for maintenance.

## Advanced Topics

- [ ] Create a continuous aggregate to calculate the hourly average price of products.
- [ ] Refresh a continuous aggregate to include the latest data.
- [ ] Downsample the `events` hypertable to store only daily summaries.
- [ ] Set up a data retention policy for a continuous aggregate.
- [ ] Use a window function to calculate a rolling average of event counts over 7 days.
- [ ] Create a materialized view to store precomputed event statistics.
- [ ] Use `time_bucket` to group events into 15-minute intervals for analysis.
- [ ] Apply a retention policy to a continuous aggregate to automatically drop old data.
- [ ] Use `JOIN` to combine `events` data with another table for enriched analysis.
- [ ] Create a custom function to calculate the total revenue per day from the `events` table.

## Additional Advanced Features

- [ ] Use `gap filling` to handle missing data in time-series queries.
- [ ] Apply `last` and `first` functions to retrieve the most recent and oldest values in a time range.
- [ ] Use `histogram` to analyze the distribution of event prices.
- [ ] Set up a policy to automatically reorder chunks for better performance.
- [ ] Use `approximate_row_count` to estimate the number of rows in a hypertable.
- [ ] Create a custom trigger to log changes to the `events` table.
- [ ] Use `time_bucket_gapfill` to handle missing data in time-series visualizations.
- [ ] Apply `percentile_cont` to calculate the 90th percentile of event prices.
- [ ] Use `hyperfunctions` to calculate the time-weighted average of event prices.
- [ ] Set up a policy to automatically compress chunks after a specific interval.
