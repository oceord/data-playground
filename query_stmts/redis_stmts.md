# Redis Query statements

> [!NOTE]
> These query statements were generated by [phind](https://www.phind.com/) to explore different aspects of redis, including lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and even support for pub/sub messaging patterns.

## Basic Operations

- [x] GET key: Retrieves the value of a key.
- [x] DEL key: Deletes a key.
- [x] EXISTS key: Checks if a key exists.
- [x] TTL key: Returns the remaining time to live of a key that has a timeout.
- [x] EXPIRE key seconds: Sets a key to expire after a given number of seconds.
- [x] INCR key: Increments the integer value of a key by one.
- [x] DECR key: Decreases the integer value of a key by one.

## Lists

- [x] LPUSH key value: Pushes a value onto the left of a list.
- [x] RPUSH key value: Pushes a value onto the right of a list.
- [x] LPOP key: Removes and returns the leftmost element of a list.
- [x] RPOP key: Removes and returns the rightmost element of a list.
- [x] LRANGE key start stop: Returns a range of elements from a list.
- [x] LINDEX key index: Gets the value at the specified index in a list.

## Sets

- [x] SADD key member: Adds one or more members to a set.
- [x] SMEMBERS key: Gets all the members in a set.
- [x] SCARD key: Counts the number of members in a set.
- [x] SISMEMBER key member: Determines if a member is a part of a set.
- [x] SDIFF key1 key2: Subtracts the second set from the first.
- [x] SINTER key1 key2: Intersects two sets.

## Sorted Sets

- [x] ZADD key score member: Adds a member to a sorted set with a specified score.
- [x] ZRANGE key start stop [WITHSCORES]: Returns a range of members in a sorted set.
- [x] ZCARD key: Counts the number of members in a sorted set.
- [x] ZCOUNT key min max: Counts the number of members in a sorted set between a minimum and maximum score.
- [x] ZREM key member: Removes a member from a sorted set.

## Hashes

- [x] HSET key field value: Sets the value of a hash field.
- [x] HGET key field: Gets the value of a hash field.
- [x] HDEL key field: Deletes a field from a hash.
- [x] HGETALL key: Gets all fields and values of a hash.
- [x] HKEYS key: Gets all field names of a hash.

## Pub/Sub

- [x] PUBLISH channel message: Publishes a message to a channel.
- [x] SUBSCRIBE channel: Subscribes to a channel.
- [x] UNSUBSCRIBE channel: Unsubscribes from a channel.

## Transactions

- [x] MULTI: Starts a new transaction.
- [x] EXEC: Executes all queued commands in a transaction.
- [x] DISCARD: Discards all queued commands in a transaction.

## Persistence and Replication

- [x] SAVE: Synchronously saves the dataset to disk.
- [x] BGSAVE: Asynchronously saves the dataset to disk.
- [x] BGREWRITEAOF: Asynchronously appends data to the append-only file.
- [x] CONFIG SET parameter value: Changes the configuration of the Redis server.

## Monitoring and Debugging

- [x] INFO: Provides information and statistics about the server.
- [x] MONITOR: Listens for all requests received by the server in real-time.
- [x] DEBUG OBJECT key: Gets debugging information about a key.
- [x] CLIENT LIST: Lists all connected clients.

## Miscellaneous

- [x] AUTH password: Authenticates to the server with a password.
- [x] PING: Checks if the server is running.
- [x] FLUSHALL: Removes all keys from all databases.
- [x] FLUSHDB: Removes all keys from the current database.
- [x] DBSIZE: Returns the number of keys in the currently selected database.
- [x] SELECT index: Selects the database for the current connection.
