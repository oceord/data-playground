# Query statements

> [!NOTE]
> These query statements were generated by [phind](https://www.phind.com/) to explore different aspects of redis, including lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, and even support for pub/sub messaging patterns.

- [ ] GET key: Retrieves the value of a key.
- [ ] DEL key: Deletes a key.
- [ ] EXISTS key: Checks if a key exists.
- [ ] TTL key: Returns the remaining time to live of a key that has a timeout.
- [ ] EXPIRE key seconds: Sets a key to expire after a given number of seconds.
- [ ] INCR key: Increments the integer value of a key by one.
- [ ] DECR key: Decreases the integer value of a key by one.

## Lists

- [ ] LPUSH key value: Pushes a value onto the left of a list.
- [ ] RPUSH key value: Pushes a value onto the right of a list.
- [ ] LPOP key: Removes and returns the leftmost element of a list.
- [ ] RPOP key: Removes and returns the rightmost element of a list.
- [ ] LRANGE key start stop: Returns a range of elements from a list.
- [ ] LINDEX key index: Gets the value at the specified index in a list.

## Sets

- [ ] SADD key member: Adds one or more members to a set.
- [ ] SMEMBERS key: Gets all the members in a set.
- [ ] SCARD key: Counts the number of members in a set.
- [ ] SISMEMBER key member: Determines if a member is a part of a set.
- [ ] SDIFF key1 key2: Subtracts the second set from the first.
- [ ] SINTER key1 key2: Intersects two sets.

## Sorted Sets

- [ ] ZADD key score member: Adds a member to a sorted set with a specified score.
- [ ] ZRANGE key start stop [WITHSCORES]: Returns a range of members in a sorted set.
- [ ] ZCARD key: Counts the number of members in a sorted set.
- [ ] ZCOUNT key min max: Counts the number of members in a sorted set between a minimum and maximum score.
- [ ] ZREM key member: Removes a member from a sorted set.

## Hashes

- [ ] HSET key field value: Sets the value of a hash field.
- [ ] HGET key field: Gets the value of a hash field.
- [ ] HDEL key field: Deletes a field from a hash.
- [ ] HGETALL key: Gets all fields and values of a hash.
- [ ] HKEYS key: Gets all field names of a hash.

## Pub/Sub

- [ ] PUBLISH channel message: Publishes a message to a channel.
- [ ] SUBSCRIBE channel: Subscribes to a channel.
- [ ] UNSUBSCRIBE channel: Unsubscribes from a channel.

## Transactions

- [ ] MULTI: Starts a new transaction.
- [ ] EXEC: Executes all queued commands in a transaction.
- [ ] DISCARD: Discards all queued commands in a transaction.

## Persistence and Replication

- [ ] SAVE: Synchronously saves the dataset to disk.
- [ ] BGSAVE: Asynchronously saves the dataset to disk.
- [ ] BGREWRITEAOF: Asynchronously appends data to the append-only file.
- [ ] CONFIG SET parameter value: Changes the configuration of the Redis server.

## Monitoring and Debugging

- [ ] INFO: Provides information and statistics about the server.
- [ ] MONITOR: Listens for all requests received by the server in real-time.
- [ ] DEBUG OBJECT key: Gets debugging information about a key.
- [ ] CLIENT LIST: Lists all connected clients.

## Miscellaneous

- [ ] AUTH password: Authenticates to the server with a password.
- [ ] PING: Checks if the server is running.
- [ ] FLUSHALL: Removes all keys from all databases.
- [ ] FLUSHDB: Removes all keys from the current database.
